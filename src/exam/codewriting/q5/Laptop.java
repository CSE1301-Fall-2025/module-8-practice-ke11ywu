	 * We wish to create a Laptop class. A Laptop is a Computer, and should inherit
	 * from the Computer class from the previous problem. The main difference
	 * between a Laptop and a Computer is that laptops have the ability to open and
	 * close. This can affect the state of the computer (whether it is asleep or
	 * not) as well as whether the button is able to be pressed. Your Laptop class
	 * should include an instance variable to track whether the laptop is currently
	 * open or not.
	 * 
	 * The beginnings of this class have been provided to you below. Examine the
	 * instructions and complete what remains.
